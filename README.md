# Temporal Gateway

Ever wondered about what life would be like if death was something completely different. What if death, instead of meaning literal death, would instead give you a new chance. See what you did wrong, and act around your mistakes. Such is the power of the temporal gateways. Legendary large structures that grant individuals eternal life. The large structures have been sought for centuries, but you, you found one of them, not by choice, but by chance. *Not all is well however.*

You see, there is a catch, while you gain eternal life, the world around you does not like this fact very much. While you might live forever, it's not going to be a relaxing life. Monsters will get stronger, you will meet more dangers, and the world itself will eventually turn on you. Even that pales in comparision to the real danger out there. Did you really think you were alone out there? You aren't, and they are coming for you.

**Temporal Gateway currently requires sponge for some of it's features.
Temporal Gateway is under active development and may never be finished.**
